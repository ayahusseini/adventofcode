## Setup 

- Setup a virtual environment using `python3 -m venv venv` and `source venv/bin/activate` 
- Install requirements by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- `cd` into the directory for a problem and run the tests using `pytest -vv`. Run the code itself with my input using `python3 day_x.py`
